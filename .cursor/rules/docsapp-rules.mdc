# Your rule content
We are running the code on Render, dont make locally running files

You will not create fix files when you are not able to get access to a larger file

We are committing and pushing changes on branch main, then we redeploy latest code on render.

All files must have a description about what it does, each function must have a description.

Maintain a file llm-context.txt that has the brief overview of what we are working on so that anytime we change model - the new LLM can understand what we have been working on.

Write simple and clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity.

For reading files use the read_file tool with smaller line ranges
For editing files use the edit_file tool with precise edits
Avoid using PowerShell commands for file operations


- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
