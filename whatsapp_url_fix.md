# WhatsApp API URL Fix

## The Exact Issue

Looking at your error logs, I can see exactly what's happening:

```
[DEBUG] 1b62c951 - URL: https://graph.facebook.com/EAAQDY035EjEBOxS3wK4XHekZBCoUGD6tY4q57vQ1RfhPw1UfFMzmZBhhi0DTbZBQOJUgzw5vtL5XjWPiFVT9PDYZBbh3ZCtUpaYZB6FadDpUfQKT3Yr29sY1tkGqdwY8ZB5BD0pcLnOFbWZAk4DCX09wIatzSW6cR43tjTJjmVBJ4NzZBJ5QkpV8AeZCxClHKOH2ZCGG7eKeSoNAePwOXFdB6OZBFxbD/571053722749385/messages
```

The token is being placed directly in the URL instead of in the Authorization header. This is causing the error:

```
Expected 1 '.' in the input between the postcard and the payload
```

## The Fix

Based on the logs, the issue is in the WhatsApp message sender code. The URL is being constructed incorrectly.

### 1. Find the Message Sender File

The file is likely `routes/handlers/whatsapp/message_sender.py` or similar. Look for a file that contains code to send messages to WhatsApp.

### 2. Fix the URL Construction

Find the line that constructs the URL. It's currently doing something like:

```python
url = f"https://graph.facebook.com/{access_token}/{phone_number_id}/messages"
```

Change it to:

```python
url = f"https://graph.facebook.com/{api_version}/{phone_number_id}/messages"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
}
```

### 3. Update the Request Call

Make sure the headers are being passed to the request:

```python
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
```

## Specific Files to Check

Based on your project structure, check these files:

1. `routes/handlers/whatsapp/message_sender.py`
2. `routes/handlers/whatsapp/handler.py`
3. `routes/handlers/whatsapp_handler.py`

## Deployment Steps

1. Make the changes to fix the URL construction
2. Commit and push the changes to your repository
3. Render will automatically deploy the updated code

## Testing

After deployment, test by sending a message to your WhatsApp bot. The logs should show:

```
[DEBUG] - URL: https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/571053722749385/messages
[DEBUG] - Headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer EAAQDY035EjEBO..."}
```

And you should receive a response from the bot.
