# DocsApp Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the DocsApp codebase to improve maintainability, readability, and organization. The main focus is on breaking down large files into smaller, more focused components with clear responsibilities.

## Goals

1. Improve code organization and maintainability
2. Reduce file sizes to make editing and debugging easier
3. Clarify component responsibilities
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Add proper documentation

## Current Issues

1. Large monolithic files (`app.py`, `user_state.py`) that are difficult to maintain
2. Mixed responsibilities within files
3. Difficulty in editing large files due to tool limitations
4. Lack of clear separation of concerns

## Refactoring Plan

### 1. `app.py` Refactoring

We'll split `app.py` into the following components:

1. **app.py** - Main application setup and entry point
   - Flask app initialization
   - Component registration
   - Main entry point

2. **middleware.py** - Request/response middleware
   - `before_request` handler
   - `after_request` handler
   - Request logging

3. **routes/api.py** - Main API routes
   - WhatsApp webhook handler
   - Document handling routes

4. **routes/auth.py** - Authentication routes
   - OAuth callback handler
   - Authentication endpoints

5. **routes/health.py** - Health check and monitoring routes
   - Health check endpoint
   - Monitoring endpoints

6. **utils/logging_config.py** - Logging configuration
   - Custom logger setup
   - Log formatting

7. **utils/startup_checks.py** - Startup checks
   - Database connection check
   - Redis connection check

### 2. `models/user_state.py` Refactoring

We'll split `models/user_state.py` into:

1. **models/user_state.py** - Main class definition (simplified)
   - Core user state management
   - Interface to other components

2. **models/auth/token_storage.py** - Token storage and retrieval
   - Database operations for tokens
   - Token caching

3. **models/auth/credentials.py** - Credential management
   - Creating credentials from tokens
   - Refreshing credentials
   - Credential validation

4. **models/auth/oauth_handler.py** - OAuth flow handling
   - Authorization code handling
   - OAuth flow management

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the new directory structure
2. Extract code from existing files into new files
3. Update imports and references
4. Add proper documentation to all files
5. Test each component individually
6. Test the entire application

## Documentation Standards

Each file should include:

1. A module-level docstring explaining the purpose and responsibilities
2. Class-level docstrings explaining the class's role
3. Method-level docstrings with:
   - Description
   - Args
   - Returns
   - Raises (if applicable)

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests for critical flows

## Deployment Strategy

1. Complete refactoring locally
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Commit changes to the main branch
4. Deploy to Render
5. Monitor for any issues

## Timeline

1. Directory structure setup - Day 1
2. `app.py` refactoring - Days 1-2
3. `models/user_state.py` refactoring - Days 2-3
4. Testing and fixes - Day 4
5. Documentation updates - Day 5
6. Deployment - Day 5
